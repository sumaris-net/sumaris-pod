Welcome to the **documentation web site of SUMARiS tools**!

Originally, the [SUMARiS project](www.sumaris.net) aimed to build a shared database of complete skate stocks.

However, these tools are now reusable **to collect many kind of halieutic data**, for many purposes such as fisheries stock assessment.
