This project is now tracked on a gitlab server at:
> https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/sih/sumaris/sumaris-pod

The current github repository is a simple clone taken up to date at each push on the main gitlab repository.

All contributions should be performed on the main gitlab repository.

Pull requests proposed on github would generate more work for the main contributors, therefore we would really appreciate if you can create instead merge requests on our hosted gitlab instance.

Thank you for your understanding.
